# The Ray Tracer Challenge
[The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) by Jamis Buck - implemented in Java

## About
The Ray Tracer Challenge is a language agnostic guide to a building a photorealistic renderer (a ray tracer!), using a test-first approach and pseudocode 
to communicate concepts. Here, I attempt to apply these concepts by implementing it in Java, with JUnit as the test engine.
